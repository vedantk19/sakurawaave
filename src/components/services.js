                  We at Sakurawave are four Otakus, here to share the plethora
                  of emotions both you and me have endlessly watched, and bat
                  about all kinds of unbounded anime content, with diversified
                  methods of interaction, through innumerous communication
                  platforms online. Our unique style of displaying and
                  representing everything we do here, includes a strong fusion
                  of a typical, retro vibe straight out of the 80s or better
                  described as “Vaporwave”; which you can read all about on the
                  right-hand side of this page.

                    <p>
                      Vaporwave comes from a sub-genre of electronic music and
                      also a particular style of art, visually. Born out
                      recently in the early 2010s, it is usually described and
                      felt due to its gradual, “chopped and screwed” versions of
                      toned-down jazz, R&B music from the 1980s and 90s.
                      Visually, it incorporates early Internet imagery, retro
                      1990s web/internet design, glitchy art and aesthetics
                      along with 3D objects often.

                      Retro anime is something that gives away something to the
                      viewers, and finds its own way to be appealing to younger
                      audiences like us. At Sakurawave we try to visually
                      portray it all with a similar grainy, low saturated motion
                      and graphics, inspired from animes produced in the 80s and
                      90s.

                      Anime (アニメ), originating from Japan. The greatest
                      creation we have come across is this flawless form of
                      animation and its diverse art styles, methods, its
                      production, and its process, and hence consider it our
                      utmost inspiration to create and emulate all done in
                      Sakurawave.
